📬 Mail Merge Project (Day 23 – 100 Days of Code)

This project is part of Day 23 of the 100 Days of Code Python Bootcamp by Dr. Angela Yu.

It is a simple automation script that reads a list of names and generates personalized invitation letters using a template.

🚀 Project Overview

The program:

Reads a template letter

Reads a list of invited names

Replaces the placeholder [name] with each person's name

Automatically generates a personalized letter for every name

Saves the letters inside an output folder

📁 Project Structure mail-merge-project/ │ ├── Input/ │ ├── Names/ │ │ └── invited_names.txt │ └── Letters/ │ └── starting_letter.txt │ ├── Output/ │ └── ReadyToSend/ │ └── main.py

🧠 How It Works

The program reads the template letter from:

Input/Letters/starting_letter.txt

It reads all names from:

Input/Names/invited_names.txt

For each name:

Removes extra whitespace

Replaces [name] in the template

Creates a new file like:

letter_for_Aman.txt

🖥️ main.py Code

Read letter template

with open("./Input/Letters/starting_letter.txt") as letter_file: letter_contents = letter_file.read()

Read invited names

with open("./Input/Names/invited_names.txt") as names_file: names = names_file.readlines()

Create personalized letters

for name in names: stripped_name = name.strip() new_letter = letter_contents.replace("[name]", stripped_name)

with open(f"./Output/ReadyToSend/letter_for_{stripped_name}.txt", mode="w") as completed_letter:
    completed_letter.write(new_letter)
📦 Requirements

Python 3.x

No external libraries required
